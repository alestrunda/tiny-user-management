# Tiny User Management

Tiny react app to manage users. Front-end only, just static sample data.

Created as a job interview assignment.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User accounts

Since the user data are static, to log in you can you these emails: `test@test.com`, `email@email.com`, `test@email.com`.

Put anything as a password, it's not checked.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
